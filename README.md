Web and Mobile Publishing Final 
-> Created in Fall 2015 for my Web and Mobile Publishing Final. For the final, I had to create my own website (could be about anything) using HTML and CSS. It had to have at least 4-6 pages, be fully responsive and be styled nicely. Bonus points were awarded for my JavaScript, creativity, extra work of creating my own content of photos, articles, social media accounts and logo.
