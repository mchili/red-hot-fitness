        <h1>5 Workout Tips for Busy Students</h1>

        <p>Struggling to find the time to workout? Follow these five steps below to never let your workout fall through the cracks.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h2>1. Lay Your Clothes out the Night Before</h2></li>
            <img src="../images/clothes500.jpg" alt="Laid out clothes" />
            <p>You finally finish your homework after a busy day of classes, meetings and socializing. The last thing you want to do before curling into your warm bed is lay out your clothes for the next day, but trust me this is a game changer. Just the act of planning out your clothes for your next workout will save you time and motivate you to commit to your workout.</p>

            <p>For your morning workout, you will have more time to hydrate and fuel yourself with your favorite pre-workout snack. Your laid out clothes will also give you a visual reminder to not hit that snooze button and get up for your workout.</p>

            <li>
                <h2>2. Plan Ahead</h2></li>
            <img src="../images/schedule500.jpg" alt="Workout schedule" />
            <p>Believe it or not, the day will come when you overschedule or become way too busy to even find a moment to yourself. And when that day comes, you’ll want to push your workout to the side. Don’t fall into this trap!</p>

            <p>There is always time for a workout. And it becomes even more important to stay with your workout when you’re stressed. So how do you stick to your workout when you haven’t eaten in hours and just want to go to bed? Make a schedule of your workouts.</p>

            <p>Start by choosing a day that usually doesn’t have too much going on for you like a Saturday or Sunday. This day will be the time you start planning your workouts for the next week. Bonus: you can use fun colored pens and highlighters to organize your schedule. This will keep you and your workout life on track.</p>

            <li>
                <h2>3. Snack Smart</h2></li>

            <img src="../images/eating.gif" alt="Homie eating food" />

            <p>Not eating enough or eating too much can ruin even the best workouts. A healthy snack will make this your best sweat fest yet. There are three main factors for a great pre-workout snack: timing, amount and type of food. Each person is different, but a good range for timing is 30 minutes to 1-2 hours for eating before a workout. If you are heading to a high intensity cardio bootcamp class you will need more food to keep you going than a relaxing yoga session. Now for the actual snack, make sure you are filling up on complex grains and protein like a piece of whole grain toast with peanut butter and bananas. If you are looking for more pre-workout snack ideas check out <a id="article" href="preworkout.html">Best Pre-Workout Snacks</a>. And don’t forget to hydrate! Food is the fuel to your workout; so don’t let it stop you from killing your workout.</p>

                <h2>4. Find a Buddy</h2></li>
            <img src="../images/workoutfriend.gif" alt="Space Jame" />

            <p>Even the biggest fitness lovers have times when they want to switch their workout session with a Netflix binge. To stay motivated, bring a buddy to your next workout. A friend will keep you on track by holding you accountable to your workouts. It will also add some extra positivity, laughter and fun to your workout, so next time you are heading to your workout, don’t forget to bring a date!</p>

            <li>
                <h2>5. Get Some Sleep</li>
    <img src="../images/sleeping.gif" alt="Ariel sleeping"/>

    <p>Yes this step seems easier said than done, but a good night sleep will change not only your workout, but also your mood and day. College is full of distractions that will keep you up for hours till you finally stumble into bed during the wee hours of the night. Try to get at least 7-9 hours of sleep when you are planning to workout to keep your body ready to take on the work. It is especially important to go to bed early when you are waking up for a morning workout. Lack of sleep can decrease a workout’s benefits such as not being able to work as hard, so don’t let your lack of sleep ruin your workout.</p>
