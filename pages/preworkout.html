        <h1>Best Pre-Workout Snacks</h1>

        <p>Ready to workout? Don’t forget to fuel up with these yummy and powerful snacks to have your best workout yet. Your go-to pre-workout snack may vary based on your stomach sensitivity and type of exercise for that day. For most standard workouts such as lifting, running, HITT, etc. you will need a combination of carbs and protein to give you endless energy and allow your body to get the best possible results out of your workout. Be sure to allow 45 minutes to an hour between your snack and workout to aid digestion.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h2>Greek Yogurt with Nuts</h2></li>
            <img src="../images/greek500.jpg" alt="Fage Greek Yogurt" />
            <p>This is my favorite pre-workout snack, especially for a HIIT workout. The Greek yogurt gives you much-needed carbs, protein and tons of probiotics that will help with digestion. The nuts add an extra dose of protein and fat, and give your snack a satisfying crunch. Opt for plain Greek yogurt for low sugar content, but if this is too tart for you choose a brand that is low in sugar content. </p>

            <li>
                <h2>Apple with Nut Butter</h2></li>
            <img src="../images/apple500.jpg" alt="Apples with almond butter" />
            <p>Have a sweet tooth? No problem, choose an apple for some sugar that won’t make you crash. Bonus: you will get some vitamins, minerals and fiber with each bite. Choose your favorite nut and pick your butter such as almond butter to add some healthy fats, protein and carbs that will keep your energy up. Add your favorite type of seed to give your snack an extra crunch.</p>

            <li>
                <h2>Oatmeal</h2></li>
            <img src="../images/oatmeal500.jpg" alt="Oatmeal" />
            <p>Choose some hearty oats and add a natural sweetener such as honey or fresh fruit to make your taste buds and stomach happy. Oats are rich in fiber and loaded with complex carbs. Complex carbs slow down your digestion and create a steady release of carbohydrates and sugar into your bloodstream. This snack will keep you feeling light, full and energized for the entire workout.</p>

            <li>
                <h2>Avocado Toast</h2></li>
            <img src="../images/avocadotoast500.jpg" alt="Avocado Toast" />
            <p>Pick a whole grain toast to pack your body with fiber and complex carbs for lasting energy. Spread some avocado on it to include healthy fats and add a sprinkle of salt and pepper for added flavor.</p>


            <li>
                <h2>Granola Bars</h2></li>
            <a href="https://risebar.com/shop/sunflower-cinnamon-protein-bars/"><img src="../images/proteinbar500.jpg" alt="Rise Sunflower Cinnamon Protei Bar" /></a>
            <p>Need a snack on-the-go? Pick a granola bar that is full of protein, fiber and low in sugar to satisfy your sweet cravings. Inspect the ingredient list for natural and raw ingredients that you recognize and can pronounce. Some good examples include Pure Peanut Butter Chocolate bars, Zing Coconut Cashew Crisp and Rise Sunflower Cinnamon Protein Bars. Bonus: these bars are all vegan to meet all your dietary restrictions.</p>

            <li>
                <h2>Caffeine</h2></li>
            <img src="../images/coffee500.jpg" alt="Coffee" />
            <p>Not big on eating before a workout? Have a cup of coffee or a shot of espresso to increase your fat-burning potential and give yourself an extra bust of energy.</p>
        </ol>
