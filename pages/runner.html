        <p>Running is a great workout for your body and mind. It torches calories with each stride, makes your heart stronger and melts all your stress away. Whether you are a newbie runner or a running pro, I’m sure you are feeling that runner’s high. Yet, your running life may be missing something if you aren’t utilizing the track.</p>

        <p>The track offers the perfect opportunity to work on your speed work and strengthen your body even more. Not only will using the track make you feel like an all-star, it will also boost your running time and endurance. Remember if you are new to speed workouts and the track, don’t push yourself too hard. You just want to stay controlled and show your body how fun the track is. Build smart and your speed and endurance will come. Now it’s time to find the nearest track and kill this workout. Choose your level of workout and find your need for speed. </p>

        <h2>Warm-Up </h2>
        <p>It is incredibly important to make sure you properly warm-up to get your blood flowing and prepare your muscles for all the work you are about to put in. Start with an easy jog for about 10-15 minutes (3-4 laps) around the track. Do dynamic stretches such as skipping, leg swings, high knees, butt kicks, karaoke, etc.</p>

        <h2>Short Distance Runners </h2>

        <h3>Advanced/Intermediate Workout</h3>
        <p>1600-1200-800-400 build speed with 2 minute jog</p>

        <h3>Beginner/Intermediate Workout</h3>
        <p>1200-800-400 steady with 2-3 minute walk/jog between each set</p>

        <h2>Long Distance Runners </h2>

        <h3>Advanced/Intermediate Workout</h3>
        <p>1600, 1-2 x 800, 1-2 x 400 build speed with 3 minute rest/easy jog</p>

        <h3>Beginner/Intermediate Workout</h3>
        <p>1600, 1-2 x 800, 1-2 x 400 moderate effort with 3 minute rest/easy jog</p>

        <h2>Cool Down</h2>
        <p>Cooling down is equally important as warming-up before your workout. The cool-down will help your heart rate slow down, regulate your breathing and circulate blood throughout your body to prevent dizziness. It is also vital for recovery; it increases mobility and speeds up lactate removal from the body to stop soreness for the next day. End your workout with an easy jog for about 10-15 minutes (3-4 laps) around the track. And finish with some deep stretches that focus on your quads, hamstrings, calves, hips and glutes.</p>
