        <h1>Quick 20-Minute Tabata Workout</h1>

        <p>Don’t have time for a butt-kicking workout? Think again. Meet your new go-to workout style, Tabata. It is a type of high intensity training that alternates between 20 seconds of heart-pumping moves and 10 second break periods for eight rounds, totaling a short, explosive four-minutes. Tabata is extremely efficient. It blasts calories, revs up your metabolism and moves so quickly you won’t have time to think about how hard you are working, leaving you sweaty and satisfied. Try this <b>20-minute, no-equipment workout</b> anytime and anywhere to give your day a sweaty boost. </p>

        <h2>Warm-Up</h2>
        <p>It is always key to warm-up before a workout to get your muscles and mind ready to exercise, but for Tabata it is even more important. This workout calls for you to perform each exercise at heart-pumping high intensity, which means your body has to work even harder to keep up. </p>

        <p>Make sure to properly warm-up for at least 4 minutes with dynamic moves before you start the Tabata rounds. Some dynamic moves include jumping jacks, high knees, alternating lunges, etc. If you have access to equipment you can also use a jump rope, stationary bike, treadmill or row machine during this time.</p>

        <h2>Tabata</h2>
        <p>Follow the Tabata style with 20 seconds active, 10 seconds rest within an AB format that alternates between exercise A and exercise B. Push yourself as hard as possible within these rounds to maximize your results and get the most out of this awesome workout! </p>
